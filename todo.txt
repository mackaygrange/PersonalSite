TODO LIST:

- Get Skills section with icons to look good while also being functional.
- If I end up keeping the colored Icon squares adjust the hover animation to shift to the same color with no opacity

- Gather pictures I want to add from my phone as well as from Teams for pictures of projects such as the airplane tug.
- Add Gallery functionality, not sure how exactly sure how I want to handle things yet.

- Start adding projects to the projects tab, look into the possibility of embedding C/C++/Python programs to show off 
various projects.

- Create some web apps that I can show off in the browser.
